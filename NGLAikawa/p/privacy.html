This is how it works:<br/><br/>The NGL app permits a user (“App User”) to generate an NGL link and then use the link to solicit messages from anyone with access to the link (the person sending an anonymous message is a “Message Sender”).<strong> <br/><br/>‍</strong>When a Message Sender clicks on the NGL link, they will be taken to a URL where they can send a message directly to the App User. The App User also has the choice to post the anonymous messages and App User’s response to the App User’s Instagram account. <br/><br/>NGL does not store the name or Instagram handle of the Message Sender, and cannot reveal this information to the App User or to others. NGL may reveal properties of the Message Sender to the App User, based on the Message Sender’s IP address or browser user agent. Additionally, NGL may share this information for compliance, safety, and integrity issues. <br/><br/>To protect the safety of our users, we employ AI content moderation services like <a href="https://hivemoderation.com/">Hive Moderation</a>. These services utilize deep learning and sophisticated algorithms to screen messages and filter out harmful language and bullying.<br/><br/>‍<strong>Personal information we collect<br/>‍</strong>We collect information about you from a variety of sources, and the type of information we collect depends on how you interact with our Services – such as whether you visit our website, download the NGL app, or send messages to App Users through the Services.<br/>‍<br/>‍<strong>Personal information you provide to us:<br/><br/>Account information, </strong>that App Users provide when they download the NGL app and sign up to use the Services.
